Status register access instructions:
    MSR, MRS - When in usermode or system mode, there is no SPSR therefore the action is unpredicatable.
    RFE, SRS - Unpredictable in Usermode.
    
Load/Store multiple instr-s: 
    LDM, STM - Unpredictable when in user mode or system mode.
    
Load/Store instr-s:
    LDRBT, LDRT, STRBT, STRT - When in user mode, acts as in user mode.
    
Coprocessor instr-s:
    Co-processor instructions manipulate co-processor data. Whether the operation is allowed in user mode is dependent on the coprocessor and the instruction. In most cases (at least all cases defined by the architecture), if a privileged operation is attempted when in user mode, a undefined exception is raised.
    
Data processing instr-s:
    ADCS, ADDS,ANDS,MOVS,MVNS,ORRS,SUBS,...
    Can all be used to change the program counter and replace the contents of the CPSR with the content of the SPSR by appending an S to the instruction and setting the destination register to the program counter.
